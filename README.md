# Number-Guessing
This short Python script creates a basic number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 40, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback (too low, too high) and continues until the player guesses the correct number. It's a simple yet engaging introduction to user input, conditionals, and loops in Python.
